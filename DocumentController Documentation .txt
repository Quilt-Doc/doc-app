Database Calls in moveDocument:
    1. Middleware fetches the Document for the documentId provided in the route
    
    2. If the document not at root, fetch the Document's old parent while removing the Document from it's parent's `children` list
    3. If moving into a non-root parent, fetch the new parent Document, run some checks
        3. a. Update and fetch the new version of the new parent Document, to add the moving Document to it's `children` list
    
    4. If moving a root-level Document to another root-level position, fetch all root level children and moving to the end, increment order given to us by 1.
    5. If moving a non-root-level Document within the same directory to the end, fetch all parent children, increment order given to us by 1.
    
    6. findByIdAndUpdate Document being moved to set order and new parent
    
    7. If not moving to root, use updateMany to increment all children of new parent whose order is >= moved Document's final order
        7. a. Fetch all the Document's that have been updated using this approach
    8. If moving to root, use updateMany to increment all children of new parent whose order is >= moved Document's final order
        8. a. Fetch all the Document's that have been updated using this approach
    
    9. If original parent was not at root, findById the original parent Document.
        9. a. use updateMany to decrement all original parent children whose order is > than the moved Document's original order
        9. b. use find to find all Documents affected
    
    10. If original parent was at root, find all Documents at root.
    10. a. use updateMany to decrement all root Documents whose order is > than the moved Document's original order
        9. b. use find to find all Documents affected
    
    11.
